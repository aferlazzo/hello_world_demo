	hello_world.html is a template file, called at templateURL, that has been defined 
	by the @Component decorator in the hello_world.ts file. It will be injected into the 
	HTML tag defined in the selector keyword and replace the contents of the DOM element.

	Initially the index.html file had <hello-world>Loading...</hello-world> in the body.
 
	data-bind to the input element; store value the user types 
	into our app's model in the variable called yourName

<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="yourName" placeholder="Enter a name here">
<hr>
<!--
	Conditionally display `yourName`, meaning if the model's variable is
	not defined, then the h1 tag will have the "hidden" attribute. Otherwise
	the value of the yourName variable (i.e. what the user typed in the
	input box above will be displayed next to the literal "Hello"

<h1 [hidden]="!yourName">Hello {{yourName}}!</h1>
