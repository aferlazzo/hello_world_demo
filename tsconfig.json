/*
	tsconfig.json is the config file for the typescript compiler. Modern browsers do 
	not presently support TypeScript, which is a variation of ES6/ES2015. We must compile, 
	or more correctly, transpile, TypeScript into something the browser will understand.
	
	Here's a description of compiler options being used with Angular 2:
	
	"target": "ES5" 
		This option tells the compiler we want it to output ES5 code, ECMAScript 5 known as 
		Javascript, which modern browsers understand.
					
	"module": "system" 
		The output for modules varies depending on the compiler's intended use, the module
		code generation: 'commonjs', 'amd', 'system', 'umd', or 'es2015' are all valid choices.
		
	"moduleResolution": "node"
		 This option determines how modules get resolved. Either 'node' for Node.js/io.js style 
		 resolution, or 'classic' (default).
		 
	"sourceMap": true, means generate a corresponding '.map' file.

	"emitDecoratorMetadata": true
			Emit design-type metadata for decorated declarations in source.
			Decorators can be spotted with the @ prefix. Here are 3 that I've seen.
			
			@Component decorator is where metadata for the selector the app is using and
			the html template to inject at that point in the html code.
			
			@Directive decorator specifies the selector identifying the attribute associated with the directive.
			
			@Input decorator adds metadata to a class that makes a property available for property binding.
			

	"experimentalDecorators": true
			Enables experimental support for ES7 decorators

	"removeComments": false
			Don't remove comments in the source
			If true, remove all comments except copy-right header comments beginning with /!*

	"noImplicitAny": false
		 If true, raise error on expressions and declarations with an implied 'any' type.
		 
	"exclude": ["node_modules"]
		The compiler looks at a directory where it is being run and attempts to compile all *.ts files.
		The "exclude" section is instructing the compiler to skip files in the array of subdirectory
		names. Here, only the "node_modules" directory will be excluded.
